      Anton Emery is a masterful guitarist acclaimed for his stunning
      arrangements of Celtic music. Playing finger-style on a steel-string
      acoustic guitar, he performs a body of music traditionally performed on
      fiddle, flute, and bagpipes, giving it a fresh voice while losing none of
      its rhythm, feel, and magical quality.

      Anton studied extensively with players such as Tony McManus, Al Petteway,
      Robin Bullock, and Steve Baughman. His repertoire ranges from traditional,
      driving jigs and reels, to gorgeous slow airs, harp tunes, and unusual
      pieces from less-well-known Celtic sources in Galicia and Brittany.

      His debut solo release, "Noone Lasses," was selected as one of the top
      Celtic recordings of 2010 by Celtic MP3s Music Magazine. Minor 7th
      Acoustic Music Reviews wrote "Anton Emery's debut CD 'Noone Lasses' has
      all the qualities of that rare album one finds in an obscure record shop
      that instantly becomes a lifetime favorite!‚Äù Anton currently lives in
      Portland, Oregon.
