Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to my new website dedicated to celtic fingerstyle guitar. I'm finally getting it up and running after my previous site being down for a while. I previously had it running on WordPress, and while that worked fine, I eventually got tired of updating plugins and wanted a different development experience. I'm a web developer at my day job, and wanted to code up something from scratch. This new site is built on Astro, a fantastic web framework for building fast content driven sites.

Ill be talking about celtic guitar, Orkney tuning, arranging tunes, and other music related topics. I'll be adding more transcriptions to the Tabs page as time permits, writing blog posts now and again, and posting links to new Youtube videos as I put them up.

Taking inspiration from Joel Hooks' [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/), this site will also be my little corner of the internet to just work on things and talk what I am doing. I've got a handful of features I would like to code up for the site. Blog posts may not be especially polished. I'm not worried about likes or shares or site traffic statistics. This site is just currently just static HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. I don't have any sort of analytics enabled, or post commenting setup.

If you have any questions or specific topics you would like to see covered please reach out.
